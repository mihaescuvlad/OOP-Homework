# Object Oriented Programming Homework

This repository has the implementation for all of the mandatory exercises handed out at the Object Oriented Programming course at the Faculty of Automation, Computers and Electronics (with some slight overengineering)

## Features

This repository covers all of the mandatory assignments in a straightforward and over-engineered manner that also makes sure to incorporate modern C++ elements.

## Motivation

The main motivation for over-engineering the homework was to improve my writing style, improve my understanding of modern C++ as well as refresh my old knowledge of OOP after a year and a half of competitive programming.

## Requirements

+ [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
