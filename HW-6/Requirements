=========Homework 6=========
T.6.1. Design and implement a class for complex numbers. Overload operators ~ for absolute value
(module), ^ for power (the recommended value for power is 2. Higher than 2, is optional) and + for
sum. Use the operators in an example.

T.6.2. Investigate how to implement operation of sum of two complex numbers using operator +. Like
complexNumber3 = complexNumber1 + complexNumber2

T.6.3. Investigate how to overload operator < to compare two complex numbers (instances of class
ComplexNumber) by their module.
