=========Homework 3=========
T.5.1. Consider the next class definition

class A
{
public:
    int aa;
protected:
    int ab;
private:
    int ac;
public:
	void testA() {
		// set the attributes in class A
	}
};

class B : public / protected / private A
{
public:
	int ba;
protected:
	int bb;
private:
	int bc;
public:
	void testB() {
		  // set values for the attributes in classes B and A
    }
};

class C : public / protected / private B
{
public:
	int ca;
protected:
	int cb;
private:
	int cc;
public:
	void testC() {
		  // set values for the attributes in classes C, B and A
    }
};

Instantiate classes A, B and C, combining the access identifiers (in red). Investigate access to all class
members, even inherited, from class C to members of C, B, A, from class B to members of class B and A,
from class A to members of class A. Call testA, testB, testC from corresponding class and check access to
class members in all possible combinations.

T.5.2. Define constructors for classes Form and Rectangle in Example 5.7, with specific messages in
console. Call constructor and destructor for Form and Rectangle. Check what is happening and the
message order. Investigate the order of calling constructor and destructors in a class hierarchy.

T.5.3. Refactor the Example 5.8. Define and implement a method called computeArea(), as member of
class Form. The method will compute the area of the form. What is the method declaration ? For
each derived class, override computeArea() and use it.

T.5.4. Define class relations (composition or inheritance), structure with attributes, methods and access
identifiers (public, private, protected) for and application managing Bus, BusStation, Address,
Apartment, Driver, Person, Commuter, Student, Mosquito, Engine, Car, Vehicle. Write method to
answer to some of the questions: 
  1) start a bus engine 
  2) how many commuters are in a bus/busstation? 
  3) what are the buses stopping in some busstation 
  4) what are the stations a bus will stop in 
  5) move an apartment from a person to a student 
  6) add a student to a busStation, bus and car 
  7) move a mosquito from an apartment to a bus or to a car 
  8) is a specific mosquito in a specificbus, car or apartment? 
  9) find a student based on some address and check if he's in a the bus driveby some specific driver
