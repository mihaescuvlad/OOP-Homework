=========Homework 7=========
T.7.1. Design a class structure for two very different vehicles, each one using four wheels. Consider using
classes like Hummer, Carriage and Wheel (the wheels are specifically design for that vehicle and
cannot be interchanged). Use one of the above class types and argue your choice. For each of the
two cars, implement data structure and methods to remove and replace a wheel.

T.7.2. Design a class structure for a Group (class Group) of Student (class Student). Use Student as
nested class in Group. Implement next operations:
  1. Add Student to a list (where to put the list ?)
  2. Display all Group(s) with their Student(s).
Pay attention to the class structure, attributes and methods.

T.7.3. Design a class structure for a Driver and Car. The relation is 1:1 (one to one), that is the Driver
drives one Car and each Car has only one driver. Implement operations like:
  1. Create a data structure to manage multiple Car(s)/Driver(s)
  2. Add remove elements from the above created data structure
  3. Show all the elements in the above created data structure and the number
  4. Investigate and argue how flexible are these data structure
Use any OOP techniques, class types or none of them but explain your approach.
